# **Low Level JS**

🚀 **Open-Source Educational Infrastructure Tools** 🚀  

This organization is dedicated to building **educational** open-source implementations of infrastructure tools using **JavaScript and Python**. The goal is to recreate, understand, and optimize technologies such as:

- **DNS Servers** 📡
- **Nginx-like Proxies** 🌐
- **Redis-style Data Stores** 🛢️
- **Bittorrent Clients & Trackers** 📥

## 🎯 **Purpose**
This is a **solo-driven** project focused on **learning and experimentation**. While contributions are welcome, the primary objective is to deepen understanding of low-level systems and network infrastructure.

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack**
- **Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js), Python
- **Concepts**: Networking, Distributed Systems, Caching, Load Balancing

## 👥 **Members**
- **[Joel Jaime](https://github.com/alblandino)** - Founder & Sole Developer

## 📜 **Disclaimer**
These projects are created strictly for **educational purposes**. They are not intended for production use but rather to serve as learning experiences and experiments in system architecture.
